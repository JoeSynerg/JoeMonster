Skills Necessary to be a Good Point Guard

1. Passing and faking skills
A good point guard must be clever and know how to pass-fake, shot-fake, fake with feet (jab steps), eyes, know how to change speeds, etc. You must also be an excellent passer (see Passing). Practice your "no-look" passes as much as your shooting.

2. Dribbling
You must be a good ball-handler, but you don't have to be the most awesome dribbler in the world. Magic Johnson was not the most awesome dribbler, but he could handle the ball very well, was very intelligent and an excellent passer, and one of the greatest players and greatest point guards ever to play the game.

You can be a very good point guard if you play under control, play smart, are able to dribble with either hand (with head and eyes forward), have a good crossover dribble, and an around-the-back dribble. See "Dribbling", "Stationary Dribbling Drills"

3. 1-on-1 moves
Learn to beat your man off the dribble, take it into the paint and shoot the short jumper or dish off. Practice and get good at finishing lay-ups under pressure, in traffic. See Perimeter Moves. The "in and out" and the "hesitation" moves are a good ones for attacking the defender in transition.

4. Outside shooting
It is another bonus if you can hit the outside shot too. See "Learning How to Shoot", "Shooting Drills"

5. Free-throw shooting
You will get fouled when attacking the paint, or late in the game when the opponent has to foul to stop the clock. So you must be a confident free-throw shooter. See "Free-Throw Shooting".

6. Handling full-court pressure - beating the press
Have good court vision, see the floor, and see the defense. Make good decisions... when to attack with the dribble, when to pass. First get open and get the ball... get open for the outlet pass off a rebound, or for the inbounds pass after a score.

Attack with speed and quickness but always stay under control and avoid turnovers. Look up court for a pass to an open teammate. Avoid traps and learn how to escape from traps. Show confidence and leadership.

7. Conditioning
You may have to play most of the game so be in excellent physical, aerobic condition by the very first practice session.

8. Defense
A good point guard shows leadership on the defensive end and can "rally the troops" to tighten things up. Work on your on-ball defense, and your ability to stop dribble-penetration. You will also get ball-screened, so learn how defend the pick and roll. Defend without fouling... this is very important. We can't have our point guard sitting on the bench most of the game in foul trouble.

9. Intangibles
As discussed above... leadership, communication, court vision, time and game management, controlling tempo, decision making, etc.
There's a lot to learn, but to me, the point guard position is by far the most fun and challenging position to learn to play.
